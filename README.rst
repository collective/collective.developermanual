Introduction
============

This is the Sphinx source for the `Plone CMS <http://plone.org>`_ 
developer manual used on the site `developer.plone.com <http://developer.plone.com>`_.

To read the documentation (formatted) in your web browser,
please head to `Plone Developer Documentation at readthedocs.org <http://collective-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

To learn how to update and manage this documentation and its tools, read 
`Writing and updating this documentation <http://collective-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference_manuals/active/writing/writing.html>`_.

Some clarifications:

* ``source`` folder contains the Sphinx manual source

* ``src`` folder will be target for Plone source code, checkouted for source code documentation inclusion

* Uploading documentation to plone.org is no longer supported - instead readthedocs.org is preferred method of distribution 

Building and continous integration
====================================

This code base uses Travis CI continuous integration 
to check the integrity of the source files.

Failed manual complies will be reported 

* plone-docs mailing list

* #plone.org IRC channel

See ``.travis.yml`` file for continuous integration settings.

* `Travis build page <http://travis-ci.org/#!/collective/collective.developermanual>`_
