Plone provides different id normalizers.

Normalizers turns arbitary string (with unicode letters) to human readable ASCII.

E.g::

	åland -> aland

Plone has conversion utilies for

* For URIs and URLs

* For filenames

* For HTML ids and CSS

Normalization depends on the locale. E.g. in English "" will be normalized as "ae" but in Finnish it will
be normalized "å" -> "a".
